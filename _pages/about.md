I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Lisbon's Faculty of Science. My research has focused on designing, developing and evaluating tools that support health and wellbeing. I hold a PhD in Human-Computer Interaction from the Univeristy of Madeira, where I was the holder of a National PhD studentship awarded by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology. Before moving to Lisbon, I worked as an Assistant Professor at the University of Twente. 

I often publish in top-tier venues in the field of HCI, such as CHI and Ubicomp. My full list of publications can be found on [google scholar](https://scholar.google.pt/citations?user=3Of_dqIAAAAJ&hl=en).
