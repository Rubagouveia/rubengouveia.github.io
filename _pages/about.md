I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Twente's Department of Design, Production and Management. My research has focused on designing, developing and evaluating tools that support health and wellbeing, particularly physical activity behaviors. Before moving to Twente, I received a PhD in Human Computer Interaction from the University of Madeira (2019) where I was the holder of a National PhD studentship awarded by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology. I also hold a MS and BS in Computer Science.

I often publish in top-tier venues in the field of HCI, such as CHI and Ubicomp. My full list of publications can be found on [google scholar](https://scholar.google.pt/citations?user=3Of_dqIAAAAJ&hl=en).
